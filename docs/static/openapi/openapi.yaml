  description: "Welcome to the *Singularity*! \n\nThis documentation covers the ready-to-use\
    \ endpoints \nfor authentication, user management, and content management that\
    \ come pre-configured with \n*Singularity*.\n\n**Features at a Glance**:\n\n-\
    \ **Authentication & User Management:** Includes JWT auth with refresh tokens,\
    \ 2FA, \n  email verification, and role-based access control.\n  \n- **Data &\
    \ Content Management:** Endpoints for interacting with a content management \n\
    \  system that supports multi-language content, configurable tagging, and built-in\
    \ \n  access control. A prebuilt `Article` class is also provided.\n  \n- **Performance\
    \ & Security:** The API is built with a focus on production-readiness, \n  including\
    \ rate limiting and secret manager integration with automated key rotation.\n\n\
    This API is a foundation for building robust backend services, microservices,\
    \ or \nfull-stack applications.\n\n>**Note:** Some endpoints require explicit\
    \ configuration to be enabled."
