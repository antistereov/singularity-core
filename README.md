> A monorepo for all my Kotlin-based Spring Web backend projects â€” secure, scalable, and production-ready by default.

This repository is the central home for all my **web backend projects**, built using **Kotlin + Spring (WebFlux)** and designed around modular, reusable libraries. Whether Iâ€™m spinning up a new SaaS idea or prototyping a service, this monorepo provides a shared, well-structured foundation to build on â€” with **security, performance, and developer experience baked in**.

## ðŸ§± **What's Inside**

The monorepo is organized into:

- `apps/`: Production-ready web applications and APIs.
- `libs/`: Reusable core libraries for authentication, storage, security, and more.

All apps in this repo share a set of internal libraries, making it easy to **get started fast**, maintain consistency, and avoid reimplementing common features.
