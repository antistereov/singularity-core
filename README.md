# Kotlin + Spring Web Baseline

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.stereov.web/baseline.svg)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.stereov.web/baseline)

This is a Kotlin-based Spring Web application template designed to provide essential features for secure and efficient web applications. 
It incorporates a wide range of functionality, such as user management, two-factor authentication, JWT-based authentication, encryption, and more, making it an excellent starting point for building production-ready applications.

**Note:** 
This repository goes hand in hand with my Angular baseline. You can find it [here](https://github.com/antistereov/web-angular-baseline).

## **Why Use This?**

This baseline serves as a **foundation for all my projects**, allowing me to avoid rewriting the same authentication, security, and backend setup every time. Instead of duplicating code, I maintain a **single, well-structured repository** where all essential features are readily available.

By using this template, you get:

- âœ… **A Pre-Built, Secure Backend** â€“ No need to implement authentication, JWT handling, 2FA, and email verification from scratch.
- âœ… **Consistency Across Projects** â€“ Ensures all my projects follow the same best practices and architecture.
- âœ… **Time-Saving Development** â€“ Focus on building features instead of setting up authentication, caching, and rate-limiting.
- âœ… **Open for Contributions** â€“ If you like this approach, feel free to contribute! The goal is to refine and expand this baseline so others can benefit as well.

This repository isn't just for personal useâ€”it's meant to be a **collaborative and evolving** foundation for secure, scalable applications. ðŸš€

## Features

### **Authentication & Security**
- **JWT Authentication**: Provides secure authentication using JWT with configurable access token expiration, refresh tokens bound to devices, and configurable token lifetimes.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Full 2FA setup, verification, and recovery flow to enhance user security.
- **HTTP-Only Authentication**: Uses secure, HTTP-only cookies to store authentication information, ensuring enhanced security.
- **Email Verification**: Configurable email verification system, including token expiration time and resend cooldown for a smooth user experience.
- **Encryption and Hashing**: Implements encryption for sensitive data, along with secure password and token hashing.

### **User Management**
- **User Roles**: Supports user roles and includes application-specific information via the `ApplicationInfo` interface.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Custom exceptions built on top of `BaseWebException`, allowing for better error handling and meaningful error messages.

### **Data Storage & Caching**
- **MongoDB Integration**: Fully integrated with MongoDB for seamless data storage.
- **Redis Caching**: Utilizes Redis for efficient caching and performance improvement.

### **Performance & Rate Limiting**
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate-limiting for both IP and user account-based limits to prevent abuse.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Built with Kotlin coroutines for async processing, and integrates Log4j for asynchronous logging.

## Example

This is a simple example of how to set up a simple service that retrieves the current user and
updates the application info for the user.

```kotlin
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service
import io.stereov.web.user.dto.ApplicationInfoDto
import io.stereov.web.user.dto.ApplicationInfoDto
import io.stereov.web.auth.service.AuthenticationService
import io.stereov.web.user.model.UserDocument
import io.stereov.web.user.service.UserService

/**
 * This is an example of how to set up custom application info for the user.
 * 
 * @param customField A custom application info to set for the user.
 * @param internalField An internal field that is not exposed to through the dto.
 */
data class CustomApplicationInfo(
    val customField: String,
    val internalField: String
) : ApplicationInfo {
    
    override fun toDto() = CustomApplicationDto(customField)
}

/**
 * This is an example of how to set up a custom application info dto.
 * It is used to expose the custom application info to the client.
 * 
 * @param customField A custom field that is exposed to the client.
 */
data class CustomApplicationDto(
    val customField: String
)

/**
 * A service that is used to set the custom application info for the user.
 */
@Service
class CustomService(
    private val authenticationService: AuthenticationService,
    private val userService: UserService
) {
    suspend fun setCustomApplicationInfo(applicationInfo: CustomApplicationInfo) {
        // Fetch the current user from the AuthenticationService
        // If the user is not authenticated, an exception will be thrown and HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED will be returned
        val user: UserDocument = authenticationService.getUserCurrentUser()
 
       // Set custom application info for the user
       user.app = applicationInfo
       userService.save(user)
  }
}
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites:
- JDK 21 or higher.
- MongoDB and Redis running locally or remotely.
- SMTP server for email verification.

### Running the Application:

**Note:** You can always look at the demo module for inspiration.

#### Dependency

Add the dependency to your `build.gradle.kts`, `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` if using Maven:

**For Kotlin DSL:**
```kotlin
implementation("io.stereov.web:baseline:<version>") // Check for the latest version
```

**For Gradle:**
```groovy
dependencies {
   implementation 'io.stereov.web:baseline:<version>' // Check for the latest version
}
```

**For Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.stereov.web</groupId>
   <artifactId>baseline</artifactId>
   <version>_version_</version> <!-- Check for the latest version -->
</dependency>
```

#### Configuration

Here are the key properties you need to set in your `application.yaml`:
- **Spring Configuration:**
    There are some things you need to set up to make things work:

    ```yaml
    server:
      # The port the server should run on
      port: 8000
    spring:
      devtools:
        restart:
          # Do you want your application to restart if changes occur?
          enabled: false
          additional-paths: src/main
        logging:
          level:
          # Set log levels for your packages
          io.stereov.web: DEBUG
    ```
  
- **MongoDB:**
   
    You need to connect your backend to a MongoDB instance. This instance is used to save information about the users.
   
    ```yaml
    spring:
      data:
        mongodb:
         uri: mongodb://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?authSource=admin&tls=<enable-tls>
    ```

- **Redis:**
           
    You need a running redis instance for rate-limiting and caching.
    ```yaml
    spring:
      data:
        redis:
          host: <redis_host>
          port: <redis_port>
          password: <redis_password>
          database: 0
          timeout: 5000ms
          ssl:
            enabled: false
    ```

- **Application Settings:**

    This sets the main configurations for the application.
    ```yaml
    baseline:
      app:
        # Optional: The name of your application. Default is "Spring Boot Application"
        name: Your Application
        # Optional: The base URL of your backend. Default is http://localhost:8000
        base-url: http://localhost:8000
        # Optional: Enable HTTPS and secure cookies for the application. Default is false.
        # Important: Never set this to false in production!
        secure: false
    ```
    
- **UI Settings:**
    
    Most probably, you are using this application to control your UI.
    You have to set some properties to make it run as expected.
    ```yaml
    baseline:
      ui:
        # Optional: The base URL of your frontend. Default is http://localhost:4200
        base-url: http://localhost:4200
    ```
      
  - **Security Settings:**
   
      You need to set up some measures to secure your web application:
      ```yaml
      baseline:
        app:
          security:
            encryption:
              # Generate an encryption key used to encrypt entries in the database
              # Note: You can create one here: https://generate-random.org/encryption-key-generator and use the Base64 value
              secret-key: <your-encryption-key>
            jwt:
              # Your JWT secret
              # Note: You can generate a secret here: https://jwtsecret.com/generate
              secret-key: <your-jwt-secret>
              # Optional: Expiration time for access tokens in seconds
              expires-in: 900
            rate-limit:
              # Optional: IP-based limit on requests in a given time window
              ip-limit: 200
              # Optional: Time window for IP-based rate limiting in minutes
              ip-time-window: 1
              # Optional: User-based limit on requests in a given time window
              user-limit: 200
              # Optional: Time window for user-based rate limiting in minutes
              user-time-window: 1
            login-attempt-limit:
              # Optional: IP-based limit on login attempts in a given time window
              ip-limit: 10
              # Optional: Time window for IP-based login attempts in minutes
              ip-time-window: 15
            two-factor:
              # Optional: Length of the 2FA recovery codes. Default is 10 characters.
              recovery-code-length: 10
              # Optional: Count of 2FA recovery codes. Default is 6.
              recovery-code-count: 6
      ```

- **Email Settings:**
   
    You can enable emails.
    This is needed to allow recovery when the user forgets their password. 
    To activate, you need to configure your own SMTP server.
    The server will send the user an email with a link to verify their email address on register
    and can email the user to recover the user account it the password is lost.
    ```yaml
    baseline:
      mail:
        # Enable email verification and password reset - false on default
        enable: true 
        # Credentials for your smtp server
        host: <smtp_host>
        port: <smtp_port>
        username: <smtp_username>
        password: <smtp_password>
        # The transport protocol - it is SMTP most of the time
        transport-protocol: smtp 
        # Enable SMTP authentication
        smtp-auth: true 
        # Enable STARTTLS encryption
        smtp-starttls: true
        # Enable debugging
        debug: false
        # How long should a token for email verification be valid?
        verification-expiration: 900
        # How much time should pass until a new verification email can be sent?
        verification-send-cooldown: 60 
        # How long a token for a password reset should be valid?
        password-reset-expiration: 900
        # How much time should pass until a new password reset email can be sent?
        password-reset-cooldown: 60
        # The path to the email verification page in the UI
        ui-verification-path: /auth/mail/verify
        # The path to the password reset page in the UI
        ui-password-reset-path: /auth/password-reset
    ```
    This is optional. You can enable email verification by setting `enable-verification` to true. 
    By default, it is set to `false`.
    
    **Note:** Password resets are not possible without email verification.
