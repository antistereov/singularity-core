# Kotlin + Spring Web Baseline

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.stereov.web/baseline.svg)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.stereov.web/baseline)

This is a Kotlin-based Spring Web application template designed to provide essential features for secure and efficient web applications. 
It incorporates a wide range of functionality, such as user management, two-factor authentication, JWT-based authentication, encryption, and more, making it an excellent starting point for building production-ready applications.

**Note:** 
This repository goes hand in hand with my Angular baseline. You can find it [here](https://github.com/antistereov/web-angular-baseline).

## **Why Use This?**

This baseline serves as a **foundation for all my projects**, allowing me to avoid rewriting the same authentication, security, and backend setup every time. Instead of duplicating code, I maintain a **single, well-structured repository** where all essential features are readily available.

By using this template, you get:

- âœ… **A Pre-Built, Secure Backend** â€“ No need to implement authentication, JWT handling, 2FA, and email verification from scratch.
- âœ… **Consistency Across Projects** â€“ Ensures all my projects follow the same best practices and architecture.
- âœ… **Time-Saving Development** â€“ Focus on building features instead of setting up authentication, caching, and rate-limiting.
- âœ… **Open for Contributions** â€“ If you like this approach, feel free to contribute! The goal is to refine and expand this baseline so others can benefit as well.

This repository isn't just for personal useâ€”it's meant to be a **collaborative and evolving** foundation for secure, scalable applications. ðŸš€

## Features

### **Authentication & Security**
- **JWT Authentication**: Provides secure authentication using JWT with configurable access token expiration, refresh tokens bound to devices, and configurable token lifetimes.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Full 2FA setup, verification, and recovery flow to enhance user security.
- **HTTP-Only Authentication**: Uses secure, HTTP-only cookies to store authentication information, ensuring enhanced security.
- **Email Verification**: Configurable email verification system, including token expiration time and resend cooldown for a smooth user experience.
- **Encryption and Hashing**: Implements encryption for sensitive data, along with secure password and token hashing.

### **User Management**
- **User Roles**: Supports user roles and includes application-specific information via the `ApplicationInfo` interface.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Custom exceptions built on top of `BaseWebException`, allowing for better error handling and meaningful error messages.

### **Data Storage & Caching**
- **MongoDB Integration**: Fully integrated with MongoDB for seamless data storage.
- **Redis Caching**: Utilizes Redis for efficient caching and performance improvement.

### **Performance & Rate Limiting**
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate-limiting for both IP and user account-based limits to prevent abuse.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Built with Kotlin coroutines for async processing, and integrates Log4j for asynchronous logging.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites:
- JDK 21 or higher.
- MongoDB and Redis running locally or remotely.
- SMTP server for email verification.

### Running the Application:

**Note:** You can always look at the demo module for inspiration.

#### Dependency

Add the dependency to your `build.gradle.kts`, `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` if using Maven:

**For Kotlin DSL:**
```kotlin
implementation("io.stereov.web:baseline:<version>") // Check for the latest version
```

**For Gradle:**
```groovy
dependencies {
   implementation 'io.stereov.web:baseline:<version>' // Check for the latest version
}
```

**For Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.stereov.web</groupId>
   <artifactId>baseline</artifactId>
   <version>_version_</version> <!-- Check for the latest version -->
</dependency>
```

#### Configuration

Here are the key properties you need to set in your `application.yaml`:
- **Spring Configuration:**
    There are some things you need to set up in order to make things work:

    ```yaml
    server:
      # The port the server should run on
      port: 8000
    spring:
      main:
        # This setting is really important to make your application reactive
        web-application-type: reactive
      devtools:
        restart:
          # Do you want your application to restart if changes occur?
          enabled: false
          additional-paths: src/main
        logging:
          level:
          # Set log levels for your packages
          io.stereov.web: DEBUG
    ```
    If you want to enable dev tools, you have to add the following dependency:
      
    ```kotlin
    developmentOnly("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools")
    ```

- **MongoDB:**
   
    You need to connect your backend to a MongoDB instance. This instance is used to save information about the users.
   
    ```yaml
    spring:
      data:
        mongodb:
         uri: mongodb://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?authSource=admin
    ```

- **Redis:**
           
    You need a running redis instance for rate-limiting and caching.
    ```yaml
    spring:
      data:
        redis:
          host: <redis_host>
          port: <redis_port>
          password: <redis_password>
          database: 0
          timeout: 5000ms
          ssl:
            enabled: false
    ```

- **Application Settings:**

    This sets the main configurations for the application.
    ```yaml
    baseline:
      app:
        # The name of your application
        name: YourApplication
        # The base URL of your API
        base-url: http://localhost:8000
        # Whether SSL and the secure setting for HTTP-only cookies should be set
        secure: true # You might need to set it to false during development
    ```
    
- **UI Settings:**
    
    Most probably, you are using this application to control your UI.
    You have to set some properties in order to make it run as expected.
    ```yaml
    baseline:
      app:
        # The base URL of your frontend
        base-url: http://localhost:4200
    ```
      
- **Security Settings:**
   
    You need to set up some measures to secure your web application:
    ```yaml
    baseline:
      app:
        security:
          encryption:
            # Generate an encryption key that is used to encrypt entries in the database
            # You can create one here: https://generate-random.org/encryption-key-generator and use the Base64 value
            secret-key: <your-encryption-key>
          jwt:
            # Your JWT secret
            # You can generate a secret here: https://jwtsecret.com/generate
            secret-key: <your-jwt-secret>
            # In how many seconds should your JWT expire?
            expires-in: 900
          rate-limit:
            # How many calls do you allow per minute per IP address?
            ip-rate-limit-minute: 200
            # How many calls do you allow per minute per account?
            account-rate-limit-minute: 100
          two-factor:
            # How long should the recovery code be?
            recovery-code-length: 20
    ```

- **Email Verification Settings:**
   
    You can require users to enable their email. Therefore, you need to configure your own SMTP server.
    This server will send the user an email with a link to verify their email address.
    ```yaml
    baseline:
      mail:
        # Enable email verification and password reset - false on default
        enable: true 
        # Credentials for your smtp server
        host: <smtp_host>
        port: <smtp_port>
        username: <smtp_username>
        password: <smtp_password>
        # The transport protocol - it is SMTP most of the time
        transport-protocol: smtp 
        # Enable SMTP authentication
        smtp-auth: true 
        # Enable STARTTLS encryption
        smtp-starttls: true
        # Enable debugging
        debug: false
        # How long should a token for email verification be valid?
        verification-expiration: 900
        # How much time should pass until a new verification email can be sent?
        verification-send-cooldown: 60 
        # How long a token for a password reset should be valid?
        password-reset-expiration: 900
        # How much time should pass until a new password reset email can be sent?
        password-reset-cooldown: 60
        # The path to the email verification page in the UI
        ui-verification-path: /auth/mail/verify
        # The path to the password reset page in the UI
        ui-password-reset-path: /auth/password-reset
    ```
    This is optional. You can enable email verification by setting `enable-verification` to true. 
    By default, it is set to `false`.
    
    **Note:** Password resets are not possible without email verification.

#### *(Optional)* Test Setup
   
I recommend the following packages if you want to test your application properly:
```kotlin
testImplementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test") {
    exclude(group = "org.junit.vintage", module = "junit-vintage-engine")
    exclude(group = "org.mockito")
}
testImplementation("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter")
testImplementation("io.mockk:mockk:1.13.13")
testImplementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-test:$kotlinxVersion")
testImplementation("org.testcontainers:testcontainers:$testContainersVersion")
testImplementation("org.testcontainers:junit-jupiter:$testContainersVersion")
testImplementation("org.testcontainers:mongodb:$testContainersVersion")
```
